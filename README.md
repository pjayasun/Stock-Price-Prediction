# Stock-Price-Prediction

Predicting stock prices is an uncertain task which is modelled using machine learning to predict the return on stocks. The stock market is considered to be very dynamic and complex in nature. In this task, the future stock prices of State Bank of India (SBIN) are predicted using the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network. Our task is to predict stock prices for a few days, which is a time series problem. The LSTM model is very popular in time-series forecasting, and this is the reason why this model is chosen in this task.
